
1. The code was developed in Java using Elipse 4.4.1 with Java SE Development Kit 7

2. The implementaion of MDPs and algorithms uses ABAGAIL library with some modification, Please include recompiled ABAGAIL.jar( under /src) in the referenced libarary

3. "src/MDP_gamble.java" is the srouce code for solving the gambler's problem with three algorithms: value iteration, policy iteration and Q-learning. you may need to change parameters in the souce code if you'd like to try different parameter settings for the algorithms, or if you need change the winning probability for the gambler, you need change the transition matrix as well.


4. "src/MDP_RL.java" is source code for solving the maze problem. you need change the file name  in source code to the corresponding maze file to load the maze problem

5. The maze load files are located under /data foder
data/maze_g.txt is the generic 10x10 maze
data/maze_l.txt is the 10x10 maze with trap design
data/maze_m.txt is the 20x20 maze with trap design
data/maze_h.txt is the 100x100 maze with trap design
