
1. The code was develeoped in Java using Elipse 4.4.1

2. The implementaion use ABAGAIL library, which can be obtained from https://github.com/pushkar/ABAGAIL

3. In Eclipse, setup a new project for ABAGAIL first. Then setup a new project for this code. Link this code to the ABAGAIL project in eclipse 

4. Part 1: The Problems Given to You
make sure the data file "ipo_train.txt" is under "data" folder.

Run IPOTest.java under "src" folder inside of Eclipse. This will run random hill climbing, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithm to train the nerual network for IPO performance problem.


5. Part 2: The Problems You Give Us

Make sure the data file for knapsack problem (myks_volumes.data, myks_weight.data) and for TSP( mytsp.data) are all under "data" folder. 

Running TravelingSalesman.java, FourPeaksProblem.java and KnapsackProblem.java inside of Eclipse will run the three optimization algorithms on the three problems used for this assignment. The paremeters for the three algorithms are set in the code and can be adjusted accordingly.
